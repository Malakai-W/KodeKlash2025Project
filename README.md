# Intrusion
This was a program I coded in C# in 2025 for a competition (KodeKlash) in my Computer Programming class at the Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center. Teammate was Samuel Hiles. The old man, gremlin, the warped, and ending 2 illustrations were done by my sister, Eva Wicker.

# What is this program?
It's a game with horror elements where you have to fend off "intruders" for at minimum a minute.
